**Take the Ordinals Challenge: Mint to 100%!**  

Welcome to **TLB MintPumpFun** – the ultimate challenge-based minting platform for Ordinals on **Fractal Bitcoin**. Mint **fairly one-by-one** at ultra-low fees with complete transparency. **Deployers** can choose to list their collections either **before** or **after** reaching 100% minting.

## Overview
Our platform revolves around **challenge-driven** minting. Users **mint Ordinals** one-by-one with **no hidden fees**, ensuring **complete fairness**. Each deployer has the freedom to list a collection at **100%** or sooner, and can **customize the minting page** to showcase a unique look and feel.

- **Challenge-Based Minting**: Aim for 100% for an extra edge or list earlier.
